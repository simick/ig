    Tries to prepend a list of prefixes to a path to see if any exists.

    This is necessary to ensure that we have unique file paths, even if the same
    file is specified differently (sometimes relative to one directory, then to
    another etc.).

    Args:
        path: The path to append to the prefixes
        perfixes: The prefixes to prepend to the path

    Returns:
